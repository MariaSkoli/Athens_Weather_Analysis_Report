# Athens_Weather_Analysis_Report
In this assignment we will explore the weather in Athens for the period 1955-2020. 
For this analysis we used the data downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information (main_dataset). However, this dataset contains missing data and therefore we used an extra dataset from Hellenic services which cover the period from 2010-2019 (support_dataset). 

The aim of this assignment is to examine and visualize the following. 
* First we will examine the deviation of Summer Temperatures. 
* Then we will see the evolution of daily temperatures among years. 
* Afterwards, we will examine the extreme temperature events among the period 1955-2020. 
* At the end, we will examine the volume of precipitation over years.
